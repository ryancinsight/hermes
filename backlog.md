# Backlog — hermes-simd

## HERMES-MNEMOSYNE-IDENTITY-2026-09-03 — Align the workspace memory provider with the Eunomia co-evolution [patch] [arch] — in-progress <a id="hermes-mnemosyne-identity-2026-09-03"></a>

- **Integrator:** Codex on `build/mnemosyne-phase12`; **lease:** none.
- **Outcome:** Advance Hermes' workspace Mnemosyne edge to PR #123 so all
  provider consumers use one first-party memory source identity.
- **Acceptance:** Standalone lock resolves only Mnemosyne `26726d2` and merged
  Eunomia main `02397fa`; workspace check, Clippy, nextest, doctests, rustdoc, and
  diff checks pass; no conversion or compatibility layer is added.
- **ADR:** [`023`](docs/adr/023-first-party-memory-source-identity.md).
- **Evidence, 2026-09-04.** Mnemosyne is now `26726d2` in the standalone
  lockfile; the locked workspace check, warning-denied Clippy, 548/548
  Nextest, 26 executable doctests, and warning-denied rustdoc pass. Windows
  Miri cannot execute the six NUMA cases that call Windows affinity APIs;
  hosted Linux Miri remains the applicable platform gate.
- **Dependency:** Mnemosyne source revision `26726d2`; the original Eunomia
  identity driver is Mnemosyne PR #123 (`7f17375`); **Last-update:** 2026-09-06.
- **Acceptance corrected, 2026-09-06 — the oracle could not see the failure
  it was written for.** "Standalone lock resolves only Mnemosyne `26726d2`"
  is satisfied by construction: any member's standalone lock resolves one
  identity. Measured from the integrator instead, Apollo's `apollo-fft`
  graph carries **three** Mnemosyne stacks over normal edges — `26726d2`
  through hermes-simd-core, `7f17375` through moirai-core, and the unpinned
  branch head through Apollo's own crates. Cargo refuses
  `-p mnemosyne-arena` as ambiguous and names all three. `26726d2` and
  `7f17375` are two points on one chain: Hermes advanced, Moirai did not,
  and pinning by `rev` is what preserved the split.
- **Change:** the `rev =` is removed, so the requirement states git+version
  and the lock holds the commit — Apollo's own model, and the reason its
  eighteen crates share one identity. The standalone lock re-resolves to a
  single Mnemosyne source (`3ebc4da1`) with one `mnemosyne-arena` entry.
  Nothing about the pin was a live quarantine; it was an advance point that
  was never cleaned up.
- **Acceptance now:** one Mnemosyne source in Hermes' standalone lock **and**
  no Hermes-attributable duplicate in the integrator's graph, tracked at
  [`atlas#atlas-mnemosyne-source-triplication`](../../backlog.md#atlas-mnemosyne-source-triplication).
  Collapsing all three additionally needs Moirai's pin and Apollo's two.

## ATLAS-HERMES-CODEGEN-SSOT-2026-08-21 — Resolve SIMD codegen source of truth [arch] [minor] — in-progress (hosted verification pending)

- **Owner / scope:** Atlas integration, clean `origin/main` lane; the former
  `crates/hermes-simd-intrinsics/src/bin/codegen.rs`, ADR 005, ADR index,
  affected PM records, and stale ADR 013 references. Runtime kernels, f16 and
  NEON implementation work, and Atlas gitlinks are out of scope.
- **Finding:** a pinned direct `rustc +1.97.0` run rewrote all four x86 f32/f64
  files and dropped 28 shipped methods; the 1424-line generator also modeled
  neither x86 f16 nor AArch64 NEON and had no invocation or freshness gate.
- **Resolution:** delete the incomplete generator; retain the checked-in ISA
  files as canonical; revise ADR 005 in place and synchronize the index,
  ADR 013, checklist, changelog, and gap audit. The alternative of restoring
  freshness was rejected because it requires a complete shipped-surface model
  absent from the audited generator.
- **Acceptance:** no executable stale generator remains; no runtime source
  file changes; ADR/index/PM references agree; provider gates pass on the exact
  commit.
- **Evidence:** source comparison before and after the direct pinned run,
  four-file destructive diff (415 deletions before restoration), and the
  method-set comparison are recorded in ADR 005 and `gap_audit.md`.
- **Local verification:** `cargo +1.97.0 fmt --all -- --check`, workspace
  Clippy with `-D warnings`, Nextest (465/465), doctests (18 executed, all
  passing; documented ignores remain), warning-denied workspace Rustdoc, and
  workspace example builds pass. The Atlas development overlay rewrites the
  provider lock during unlocked local commands; its derived lock changes were
  discarded. Hosted locked CI remains the delivery gate.

## Legacy HS-4xx record — open items and measured limits

In full: the open measurement items, the limits they rest on, and the rejected refactors. The rest of the era is one line each below.

- [x] [minor] **HS-437 — lane scratch buffers are sized to the workspace
  maximum.** The `SimdKernel` default methods and `kernel_helpers` declare
  scratch as `[MaybeUninit<T>; MAX_SIMD_LANES]` with `MAX_SIMD_LANES = 64`,
  the widest backend/type pair in the workspace, rather than the backend's own
  `LANE_COUNT`. `interleave`/`deinterleave` each declare four such buffers, so
  a NEON `f64` call (2 live lanes) reserves 2 KB of stack to move 32 bytes.
  Correctness is not affected — the buffers are deliberately over-sized, not
  over-read, and `LANE_BOUND_CHECK` pins the bound at compile time.
  `Self::LANE_COUNT` cannot be an array length in a default body on stable, so
  the fix is an associated `type LaneBuffer` (or const-generic lane parameter)
  that each backend fixes to its exact width.
  Closure evidence: release assembly wrappers for the default `interleave`
  path at Scalar f64, emulated `SveArch` f64, and AArch64 NEON f64 show no
  stack allocation in the wrapper. x86-64 emits register moves/instructions
  directly; AArch64 emits `zip1`/`zip2` and `stp` directly. The AArch64 target
  emitted assembly before its Windows-host linker rejected the foreign
  `--eh-frame-hdr` option; no cross-target execution claim is made. The typed
  `LaneBuffer` refactor is therefore not justified: LLVM already removes the
  over-sized source arrays from these default-path frames, while
  `MAX_SIMD_LANES` remains the compile-time safety bound.

  Re-measured 2026-08-15, independently, because one of the three data points
  above does not support the conclusion it was cited for: **NEON overrides
  `interleave`/`deinterleave`** (`aarch64/neon_f32.rs`, `neon_f64.rs`), so the
  NEON f64 wrapper measures a native override, not the default body. AVX2 —
  the backend that actually takes the default path on x86-64 — was not covered.
  The conclusion holds, but on different evidence:

  | probe (release, `--emit asm`) | lanes | `sub rsp` | rsp/rbp traffic |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | Scalar f32 / f64 | 4 / 2 | 0 | 0 |
  | SveArch f32 / f64 | 16 / 8 | 0 | 0 |
  | AVX2 f32 / f64 | 8 / 4 | 0 | 0 |
  | AVX2 f64, `interleave` alone | 4 | 0 | 0 |

  Each probe is an `#[inline(never)] extern "C"` wrapper so it owns its
  prologue; the AVX2 ones carry `#[target_feature(enable = "avx2,fma")]`. The
  full-chain probes run `interleave` + `deinterleave` + `reverse` +
  `swap_adjacent` — ten `[MaybeUninit<T>; 64]` declarations, up to 5 KB at f64
  if any of it materialised. None does.
  The instrument was checked rather than trusted, since a zero reading and a
  measurement of nothing look identical: `hs437_avx2_f64_interleave_only`
  emits `vaddsd` / `vunpcklpd` / `vaddpd` / `vshufpd` / `vaddsd` / `retq` —
  the four 512-byte arrays lowered to one `vunpcklpd`. `SveArch` f64, whose
  vector is an emulated array and so the hardest case for SROA, emits twelve
  register instructions and zero `(%rsp)`/`(%rbp)` operands.
  Per repository convention (see the note in `benches/permute.rs`) the probe
  was a one-off and is not committed; it is reconstructible from this record.
  Conclusion unchanged and now covering the default path on this host: the
  typed `LaneBuffer` refactor buys nothing measurable. Re-open only if a future
  backend's default-path frame shows a non-zero `sub rsp`.

- [x] [patch] **HS-428 — identify and assert per-runner backend coverage.**
  Backend selection is automated from runtime probes, which is correct, but a
  probe-guarded test that does not run does not fail either — it skips, and a
  skip is indistinguishable from a pass. That is how this workspace carried a
  green CI in which no AVX-512 path had ever executed.
  Primary mechanism (real hardware, no emulation): `TargetId::{ALL, from_name,
  supported_on_host, is_architecture_applicable}` let a harness enumerate the
  closed set and identify what the host executes. A coverage test prints the
  matrix in every job via a `--no-capture` step and asserts against
  `HERMES_EXPECTED_TARGETS`, declared per runner as configuration: the aarch64
  runner must execute NEON on real silicon, the x86 runner must execute AVX2.
  The report distinguishes three outcomes — executes, NOT COVERED (architecture
  applies, CPU lacks it), n/a (different architecture) — because collapsing the
  last two makes an ARM log read as missing AVX-512.
  Fallback only where no selectable silicon exists: AVX-512 cannot be requested
  on GitHub-hosted runners (some x86 machines have it, some do not, and this
  repository had no self-hosted runners), and AMX is unavailable there
  entirely. `test-avx512-sde` therefore ran the suite under Intel SDE emulating
  Sapphire Rapids (444/444 in 176s, ~11x native) through the cargo target
  runner, so only test binaries paid the cost. Its identification step ran under
  the emulator too, so passing was a hard assertion that SDE satisfies the
  runtime probes rather than merely not breaking. It used a dedicated
  `[profile.sde]` 300s budget; the 30s native budget was untouched. The job and
  profile remain the deterministic semantic gate; HS-429 adds best-effort
  native timing on hosted silicon.
  Known limit: SDE validates semantics, never performance — any benchmark claim
  still requires real silicon. See HS-429.

- [ ] [minor] **HS-429 — real AVX-512/AMX silicon for performance evidence.**
  SDE gives deterministic semantic coverage but cannot support a performance
  claim, so HS-427's "override beats the default" acceptance is unsatisfiable
  under emulation. Acceptance: an AVX-512 job on real silicon whose coverage
  step asserts `scalar,avx2,avx512` without the emulator, plus a criterion
  baseline captured there. If a deterministic real-silicon source were adopted,
  the SDE job would become redundant and be deleted rather than kept alongside.
  Decided 2026-08-16: the RunsOn Flex `family=c7i` option (AWS account,
  CloudFormation stack, license key, GitHub App install — user-side
  provisioning) was rejected; billing the user's own cloud account to pin an
  instance family was the wrong cost. Instead `test-avx512-hosted` runs on the
  existing GitHub-hosted x86 pool and covers AVX-512 on a best-effort basis:
  it records the machine class, asserts `scalar,avx2` plus `avx512` only when
  the host silicon has it, and captures the permute A/B (`--save-baseline
  avx512-native` then generic-default compare) only on such hosts. Hosts
  lacking the silicon print AVX-512 as NOT COVERED in the coverage report and
  skip the benchmark loudly, so coverage never degrades silently; the SDE job
  is retained as the deterministic semantic gate, since hosted x86 is
  heterogeneous — that determinism was the premise that made SDE redundant,
  and it no longer holds. Drafted as `test-avx512-hosted` alongside the
  retained `test-avx512-sde` job; `[profile.sde]` stays. AMX admission remains
  kernel-dependent and is never asserted.

- [x] [minor] **HS-427 — native permute overrides beyond AVX2 reverse.**
  Delivered with one premise falsified. AVX-512 f32/f64 override all three ops
  (`vpermps`/`vpermpd` for reverse, `vpermi2ps`/`vpermi2pd` for the two-vector
  permutes, whose index space is the flat `a || b` concatenation the trait
  contract is written on); NEON f32/f64 override all three (`rev64` + `ext`,
  `zip1`/`zip2`, `uzp1`/`uzp2` — NEON's zip/uzp are whole-register, so at
  128-bit width they *are* the flat operations). Correctness is verified by the
  existing HS-424 differential and round-trip tests on the SDE and aarch64
  runners, unchanged.
  **The AVX2 interleave/deinterleave overrides were written, measured, and
  removed.** `unpack` + `permute2f128` is a *37% regression* against the
  generic store/permute/load default at L1-resident size (two runs agree,
  p < 0.05), and deinterleave was neutral-to-negative. LLVM already lowers the
  generic default's stack round-trip into good shuffle sequences, so the
  hand-written cross-half fixup buys nothing and costs latency. AVX2 `reverse`
  survives on measurement: 10.4% faster at 1024 f32, 2.8% at 1024 f64.
  Committed `benches/permute.rs` is the regression baseline. Measure at the
  L1-resident size — at 16384 elements the working set spills and the permute
  cost disappears into memory traffic, which is why the two sizes disagree.
  Residual: AVX-512 and NEON override *performance* is unverified. SDE cannot
  measure it (HS-429) and the aarch64 job runs no benchmark. Given the AVX2
  result, these may not pay either; they are kept as correctness-equivalent
  canonical lowerings, not as a speed claim. Follow-up HS-430.

- [ ] [patch] **HS-430 — measure the AVX-512 and NEON permute overrides.**
  HS-427 shipped them on correctness alone. The AVX2 result — a hand-written
  native sequence losing 37% to the generic default — is the reason this cannot
  be assumed. Method: the override-versus-default comparison HS-427 used, which
  is a `#[cfg(any())]` gate on the override plus a criterion
  `--save-baseline`/`--baseline` pair on a quiet host. NEON needs a bench step
  on the existing aarch64 runner; AVX-512 needs HS-429's real silicon.
  The aarch64 workflow now runs the existing `permute` Criterion target twice:
  first with the native NEON methods and a `neon-native` saved baseline, then
  with the three NEON overrides disabled by the explicit
  `hermes_benchmark_generic_default` benchmark configuration and compared
  against that baseline. The command is bounded at 300 seconds and uses the
  same inputs, groups, and Criterion settings in both runs, so the result is a
  real-silicon A/B measurement rather than a compile-only claim.
  Acceptance: each override either shows a significant win and stays, or is
  deleted like the AVX2 pair.
  UNBLOCKED as of HS-428 — both preconditions were already satisfiable and the
  original entry was wrong to defer on runner availability. aarch64 has had a
  native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` job running the full suite all along (and
  `cargo check --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` type-checks NEON locally
  with no ARM hardware); AVX-512 is now executed under SDE. The HS-424
  differential and round-trip tests already contain the per-backend branches,
  so an override is validated on push.
  HS-424 left `interleave`/`deinterleave` on the generic default for every
  backend, and `reverse` native only on AVX2. AVX-512 can express all three in
  one instruction (`_mm512_permutexvar_ps` for reverse, `_mm512_permutex2var_ps`
  for the two-vector permutes); NEON needs `vrev` plus a half swap for reverse
  and `vzip`/`vuzp` for the pair ops, which do match flat semantics at 128-bit
  width. AVX2 flat interleave needs `unpack` plus `permute2f128` because
  `unpack` is per-128-bit-half. Not shipped in HS-424 because the index math is
  unverifiable on the developer host, which reports avx512f=false and is not
  aarch64, and untested permute index math silently returns plausible-but-wrong
  lanes. That reasoning was right about the risk and wrong about the remedy:
  the verification exists in CI, so the overrides are written and pushed rather
  than deferred. Acceptance: the existing HS-424 differential and round-trip
  tests pass unchanged against each native override on the aarch64 and SDE
  jobs, plus a benchmark showing the override beats the store/permute/load
  default.
  The hosted aarch64 comparison ran in PR #37's exact source-head workflow
  (run `31694336159`). `reverse_f32` and `reverse_f64` were statistically
  unchanged against the generic default, so both NEON overrides were deleted.
  Large `interleave_f32` and `deinterleave_f32` improved 1.27% and 1.40%
  respectively; their native overrides remain. The smaller rows were within
  Criterion's noise threshold. AVX-512 performance remains open under HS-429
  because SDE is semantic evidence only.

## Atlas in-house replacement roadmap — hermes slice [arch]

hermes is the Atlas **SIMD SSOT** (data-parallel lanes), replacing std::simd / packed_simd
and hand-rolled intrinsics. Scope boundary: hermes owns SIMD only; thread-level **MIMD**
is moirai's domain, GPU is the `hephaestus` substrate (wgpu + CUDA) via coeus/apollo. Work to make hermes the
complete SIMD substrate for leto-ops/coeus hot kernels:
- [ ] [minor] Stage C1: dedicated AVX-512 / AMX CI runners (currently self-skip on
  unsupported hosts), `no_std` feature matrix, committed criterion baselines.
  Partial delivered (2026-06-12): local AVX2 Criterion baseline refreshed with
  packed4 COW unpack and unrolled complex `mul_assign` rows; runner self-check
  covered 48 rows. Dedicated AVX-512/AMX runners remain open.
- [x] [patch] Stage C1: `SveArch` callable fallback (stub removal) — delivered
  2026-06-13 as a value-preserving 512-bit-shape emulated backend for f32/f64.
- [x] [minor] Stage C1: `SveArch` public marker + property coverage —
  delivered 2026-06-13 by re-exporting it from `hermes-simd` and adding it to
  the host-independent kernel property suite.
- [ ] [minor] Stage C1: native SVE intrinsic backend for AArch64 server targets.
  Blocked by the pinned stable Rust toolchain: `SveArch` remains a safe,
  value-semantic lane-emulated backend, while `SveArch::is_native_hardware_supported`
  reports hardware capability separately. Revisit when stable scalable SVE
  vector types are available or an explicitly approved asm/C boundary is added.
- [ ] [minor] Stage C2: expand op/dtype coverage on demand from leto-ops/coeus
  (gather/scatter variants, additional reductions/scans, complex precisions) so every
  leto/coeus CPU hot kernel has a hermes path rather than a scalar fallback.
  Delivered (2026-06-12): abs-sum (`Σ|x|`) and abs-max (`max|x|`) slice
  reductions via `AbsSum`/`AbsMax` ReductionOp ZSTs + `SimdOps::{abs_sum,
  abs_max}` dispatch. The reduce loop's unrolled head previously seeded
  accumulators with raw loads and merged partials with `accumulate` — correct
  only for transform-free ops; it now seeds through `transform_vector` and
  merges through `combine_vectors`, fixing the latent defect for every
  transform-bearing reduction (the documented SquaredSum hook included).
- [x] [patch] Document the SIMD(hermes) vs MIMD(moirai) vs GPU(hephaestus: wgpu + CUDA)
  boundary in README so consumers compose the three deliberately. Delivered
  2026-06-12: README defines Hermes as the synchronous, slice-oriented SIMD
  substrate; Moirai owns thread-level partitioning; Hephaestus owns GPU
  resource lifetimes and device-resident kernels.

### Operation-family coverage map <a id="operation-family-coverage-map"></a>

Consumer admission rule: a family becomes implementation work only when an
Atlas consumer names a hot path or contract that requires it. Public APIs remain
Hermes-native, monomorphized, and backed by value-semantic tests before a row is
marked delivered.

- [x] [minor] Arithmetic: dense `sum`, `dot`, elementwise add/sub/mul/div,
  `axpy`, `axpy_rows`, `axpy_rows_batch`, sparse SpMV, and tiled GEMM/GEMV are
  present with scalar fallback and runtime dispatch.
- [x] [minor] Reductions: `sum`, `min`, `max`, `argmin`, `argmax`, `abs_sum`,
  `abs_max`, dot, masked reductions, and COW reductions are present.
- [x] [minor] Masks/select: `BitMask`, masked dense operations, `select`,
  `masked_negate`, mask round-trip property coverage, and safe target-forced
  dense conformance are present.
- [x] [minor] Memory: typestate `SimdView`, `AlignedVec`, COW promotion,
  packed4 COW unpack, safe one-vector load/store wrappers, and gather are
  present.
- [x] [minor] Shuffle/rearrange: complex adjacent-pair primitives
  (`swap_adjacent`, `dup_even`, `dup_odd`, `fmaddsub`, `fmsubadd`) and packed
  unpacking are present where consumer kernels require them.
- [x] [minor] Float-specialized: interleaved complex multiply/dot, norm,
  normalize, absolute reductions, and sqrt/abs/clamp unary strategies are
  present.
- [ ] [minor] Scatter/compress-store family: add only when an Atlas consumer
  needs indirect writes or compaction output; current delivered scope covers
  gather and mask/select, not scatter.
- [ ] [minor] Comparison predicate family: add lane-wise compare APIs only when
  a consumer needs reusable predicate outputs beyond existing min/max/select
  contracts.
- [ ] [minor] Conversion family: add vectorized widening/narrowing conversion
  APIs only when a consumer needs conversion as a public SIMD operation;
  current packed4 unpack is format-specific and owned by packed storage.
- [ ] [minor] Bitwise public facade family: add public bitwise dense APIs only
  when a consumer requires them; strategy ZSTs exist, but a broad public facade
  is not admitted without demand.
- [ ] [minor] Crypto/hash family: out of current Hermes scope unless an Atlas
  consumer requires lane-parallel primitive support; no implementation is
  claimed.
